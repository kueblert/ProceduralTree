# ProceduralTree
Procedural trees and some algorithms that are required to create, modify and display them.
Currently, there are
- an implementation of general Ball-B-splines for the representation of a tree skeleton [Ao, Xuefeng, Zhongke Wu, and Mingquan Zhou. "Real time animation of trees based on BBSC in computer games." International Journal of Computer Games Technology 2009 (2009): 5]
- Guiding vector trees [Xu, L., & Mould, D. (2015, October). Procedural tree modeling with guiding vectors. In Computer Graphics Forum (Vol. 34, No. 7, pp. 47-56).]
